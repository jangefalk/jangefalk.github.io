<img src="/images/mainframe.jpg" class="fit image"> Are you an former student or are you maybe studying right now? Let me ask you this.
Do you know what the IBM Mainframe is? If you live in America or Canada and studying some IT program you proberly do. 
But do you live in Europe and specially in Scandinavia you probably dont know what the mainframe is. How come?

The first thing we should check is, does the schools talk about the mainframe and what does the companies do to
encourage people to get mainframe skills? In Sweden and all over Scandinavia there is not to many curriculom courses 
that offers mainframe courses like IMS, CICS, Z/OS, DB2 etc. You could count the numbers of courses in Scandinavia on one single hand, 
proberly even less than three fingers.

But why is it so? The Mainframe has been around for more than 50 years and are still going strong. The release of the z13 was a big milestone for IBM to 
still staying the market leader for heavy transactions systems. But again why have the universities in Scandinavia no Mainframe courses?

Let me try to answer these questions from my perspective in an Scandinavian environment.

First the demand on mainframe skills is not in the same range as for any Software developer developing in C#, C or Java. The number of people who
worked with the mainframe 20 years ago are not required anymore for doing the same tasks, because of the platform evolving continously. 
The other thing is that the Swedish companies with Mainframe as their core transaction system are not hiring in the pase they need to do.

If you look at the average age for the system programmers at any comapny that works with the Mainframe. The average age are almost always over 55+.
And these guys are really pros all of them. The majority of them has built their whole carrier around the mainframe. 
But no one can stop time and soon these people will retire and who will fill their place? Or what happends if an tragedy accours with one of 
these people, sickness, accidents whatever. You cant predict the future and you got to have a pile to get things out of when the not expected accours.
For an big institution or any company for that matter, you cant build the systems that circles around one key person and if something should happend
to that person you stand there with NOTHING.

But could it also be the mentality of the companies that strangles the hiring of people that wants to work with the mainframe. 
Everybody wants the best and with the longest experience. That fact no one can lie about in any field of experties. And no one wants be the company
for education of mainframe personal. Education cost both in money and in time and those two together are really a sensitive area. 

But if no one takes on the role as educator where will we end up? The answer is already here. Companies will be out looking for personal because of
retirment and other causes. And skilled mainframe personal are no where to be found. The Scandinavien companies have to get together and first of all 
stop fighting about who should be the educator and take equal responsibility. Then they have to work close to the swedish universities and try to 
get some mainframe courses on the schedule. Both courses for development in Assembler, COBOL, PL1 and so on. But also courses for just IMS, CICS, DB2, z/OS, z/Linux,
Storage and so on. 

If the companies cant get together on this point the nearest future is not so bright for the mainframe.

Until next time keep hacking!
