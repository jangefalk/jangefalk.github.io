<p>A few years ago a swedish goverment had a security breech in their mainframe. Big amount of data in their RACF system were penetrated
and about 100 000 users credentials were stolen and published out in the free. How could this happend? Is not the mainframe sold as the most secure
platform there is? The reputation of the mainframe is often told that it cant be hacked. 
The incident in Sandinavia a few years back proves that the mainframe is not 100 % secure. No platform is. </p>

<p>Phil Young talks about the security on the platform and points out that the security testing must improve on the platform. 
More "Red" teams must be used for the testing of the security. The mainframe platform still relies on its reputation that it
is the safest platform on the planet. But if the platform is not continously tested the security breeches will happend more often. 
And because everyones money is in the mainframe Phil Young points out that a change of attitude needs to be done for testing on the platform.
